GSM4259354,"disease state: Lung adenocarcinoma,tissue: brain,age: 28,Sex: female","The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing and single-cell 3′ gene counting.First, sample demultiplexing was performed based on the 8 bp sample index read to generate FASTQs for the Read1 and Read2 paired-end reads, as well as the 14 bp GemCode barcode.Ten base pair UMI tags were extracted from Read2. Then, Read1, which contains the cDNA insert, was aligned to an appropriate reference genome using STAR. The genome reference is ""refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-3.0.0.""  which was downloaded from 10x Genomics was used for read alignment.Count datasets from cell ranger were further processed with Seurat v3 R package,Genome_build: GRCh38,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Matrix of gene counts with genes in rows and barcodes in columns,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: List of metadata for each cell","Public on Jan 11, 2020",,GSE143423,,brain,LUAD brain met1 scRNA-seq
